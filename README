Unofficial Python AudioBox.fm Upload Script
Copyright (C) 2010 Kevin Riggle <kevinr@free-dissociation.com>
Released under the terms of the GNU GPL v2

To install:
* uncompress the source distribution or git clone the repository into your 
  home directory (I like ~/src)
* create a symlink from abup.py in the place you installed the distribution to
  $HOME/bin, like so
        ln -s $HOME/src/audiobox-uploader/abup.py $HOME/bin
* $HOME/bin is in your $PATH, right?

To use:
* you can either specify your AudioBox username and password by editing the 
  username and password variables in the abup.py script, or by supplying the 
  -u option on the command line when you run the program
* running `abup.py --help` will provide you with a list of other command line 
  options and their uses
* upload music!

abup.py doesn't currently support bandwidth limiting, but if you need it (eg.
so as to not annoy your housemates by saturating the house net connection's 
uplink), it works great with the 'trickle' utility, available from an Apt 
repository near you!
